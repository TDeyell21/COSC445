HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT 2 – FERMAT’S LAST THEOREM

** DESCRIPTION ** 
This program is designed to ‘prove’ Fermat’s Last Theorem which claims no natural numbers x, y, and x exist such that xn+yn=zn where n>2. For simplicity, x and y are bounded above by a natural number k, and below by 10 inclusive. The program prompts the user to input values for y and k. It then searches for (x,y,z) tuples that almost satisfy xn+yn=zn. The program calculates the miss ratio and outputs it. 

** REQUIREMENTS ** 
This program is written in and requires Java SE 8.

** INSTALLATION **
Download the source file Fermat.java from GitHub https://github.com/TDeyell21/COSC445/blob/main/Fermat's%20Last%20Theorem/src/Fermat.java
Run it using the IDE of your choice, or using Windows command line or UNIX/macOS Terminal.  

** CONFIGURATION **
The program does not have modifiable settings. There is no configuration.
